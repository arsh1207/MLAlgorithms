# MLAlgorithms
This project is towards the completion of the course COMP6321 - Machine Learning

This project is divided into three parts.

# Part 1 : Classification

In this part 8 famous machine learning algorithms like Knn, decision Tree, Neural Nets etc are used to analyse 10 different datasets from UCI dataset repository and the algorithm are compared with each other.


# Part 2 : Regression

In this part 7 famous machine learning algorithms like decision Tree regressor, linear regression etc are used to analyse 10 different datasets and the algorithms are compared

# Part 3 : Activation Maximisation
