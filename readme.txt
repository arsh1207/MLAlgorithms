Classifier Interoperability:
The code for all the three tasks(CNN, DTree, A.M.) is under the python notebook Gp31_Classifier_Interpretability.ipynb.
The code for all three task is runnable under the same cell - so it is just one click away.
Note - Data (Cifar 10) is not included for this part, please include the data before running the code cell


Classification:
Please download the datasets before running the code.
The entire code is available in the jupyter notebook file Group31_Classification_Project.ipynb
The Last Cell in notebook file contains the scripts/function call to activate whole classification problems
All the above cells contains the Classes for the Classification Data Set
The Remaining files in this folder represent the Data
Please open the ipynb file and go to last cell  and press Ctrl + Ent to run the classification part of project
It might take 30 mins to 1 hr, you can see the commments as the code progresses
